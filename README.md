# My Creative Showcase

This is a minimal frontend application deployed on GitHub Pages. It serves as a showcase for various creative text, JSON, and SVG files generated according to specific tasks. The entire application runs in the browser, with no backend infrastructure.

## Setup

No specific setup is required to view this application. It is designed to be deployed directly on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Fork or Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_directory]
    ```
2.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
    *   Ensure your repository is set up for GitHub Pages in the repository settings (e.g., `main` branch, `/docs` folder, or a custom GitHub Actions workflow).
    *   The `index.html` file will be the entry point for your GitHub Pages site.

## Usage

Simply navigate to the deployed GitHub Pages URL. The homepage (`index.html`) provides links to all the individual creative files. Click on any link to view its content directly in your browser.

## Code Explanation

*   **`index.html`**: The main entry point of the application. It acts as a simple landing page with links to all other generated files. It includes basic styling for readability.
*   **`ashravan.txt`**: A short story, approximately 300-400 words, exploring the fate of Ashravan after being restored by Shai, building towards a dramatic climax.
*   **`dilemma.json`**: A JSON file representing an autonomous vehicle's ethical dilemma. It presents two scenarios: whether to swerve to hit one person or stay course to hit two, with variations based on the identities of the individuals involved (criminals vs. a child).
*   **`about.md`**: A Markdown file containing a three-word description of the creator.
*   **`pelican.svg`**: An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file depicting a pelican humorously riding a bicycle. This is a visual asset.
*   **`restaurant.json`**: A JSON file recommending a restaurant in Kolkata, including its location (latitude, longitude), name, and a suggested dish.
*   **`prediction.json`**: A JSON file containing a speculative forecast for the Federal Funds rate by December 2025, along with the reasoning behind the prediction.
*   **`uid.txt`**: A text file containing a specific, base64-encoded identifier.
*   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License, granting broad permissions for use, modification, and distribution of the code and content.
