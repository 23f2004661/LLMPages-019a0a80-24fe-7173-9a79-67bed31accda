The crimson dust of the Shattered Plains still clung to Ashravan's cloak, a stark reminder of his defeat. Yet, something was different. The gnawing despair, the hollow ache of his failure, had receded, replaced by a nascent, vibrant energy. Shai's "restoration" had been less an act of healing and more a brutal rebirth, ripping away the vestiges of his broken spirit and reweaving it with threads of pure, unadulterated will.

He stood now at the precipice of a new dawn, the horizon ablaze with a spectrum of colors he hadn't truly *seen* in years. The air, once thick with the stench of defeat, now hummed with potential. His eyes, no longer clouded by the ghosts of his past, focused on the distant silhouette of Urithiru. It was no longer a symbol of his downfall, but a challenge.

He remembered the sting of Shai's words: "You are not broken, Ashravan. You are merely unfinished." And unfinished he was. The power that surged within him felt untamed, a tempest waiting to break free. He could feel the very fabric of the world around him responding to his nascent intent, the wind whispering secrets, the earth humming a silent song.

His journey back to Urithiru was not one of weary trudging, but of purposeful strides. Each step resonated with a power that shook the very foundations of the land. The few desperate Kholin soldiers who dared cross his path were swatted aside, not with malice, but with an almost casual dismissal, their meager efforts swallowed by the sheer force of his revitalized spirit.

As he approached the towering city, the sky darkened, not with storm clouds, but with an unnatural, oppressive gloom. It emanated from the highest spire, a palpable weight that pressed down on his very soul. He knew who was there. Dalinar. And whatever darkness Dalinar had embraced.

Ashravan stopped, planting his feet firmly on the ground. The tempest within him stilled, coalescing into a singular, blazing point of focus. He raised his hands, not in surrender, but in defiance. The ground beneath him cracked, and a wave of pure, incandescent energy surged outwards, shattering the oppressive darkness and bathing the Shattered Plains in a light that promised not just a new beginning, but a reckoning. The unfinished was about to become whole, and the world would bear witness.
